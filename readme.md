# henr.ee

This is my experimental 3D personal portfolio site, largely extended from Heffernan's framework (see attribution). One of two repositories created for this portfolio project, this one being the 3D container of the 2D computer content. You can find the 2D computer OS [here](https://github.com/braindead-dev/os.henr.ee).
